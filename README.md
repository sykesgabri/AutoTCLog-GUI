# AutoTCLog-GUI
A version of [AutoTCLog](https://github.com/sykesgabri/AutoTCLog) with a GUI interface. Writing timecode logs manually is tedious and time consuming. AutoTCLog-GUI gets the worst of it done fast so you only have to fill in the easy parts.

# IMPORTANT: This code is still very unfinished and has some bugs that AutoTCLog does not have.

Known bugs:
* On Windows, file paths are displayed in the output file with a combination of back and forward slashes. The program still works regardless, but it's a bit annoying.
